## Async C# 5.0 - Patters For Real World Use ##

This repository provides the presentation, and source code for the samples and tutorial for the presentation given on 4th June 2014 at NDC Oslo.

----------

## Abstract ##

The new Async features come along with the very useful WhenAll and WhenAny methods to execute sets of tasks.

We will delve into how these work, the effect of exceptions within any individual task and cancellation. This leads to the creation of common patterns such as Redundancy, Interleaving, Throttling and Early Bailout.

Given time we'll also get to peek at progress reporting, something that provides the feedback to add further sophistication to these common patterns.

Expect overviews of the patterns, followed by lots of code samples so get the latest Visual Studio 2012 RC installed ready for action.
